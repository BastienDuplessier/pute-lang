# Programers Use Text Editors

A small experimental and minimalist language named pute because it's fun to name something PUTE. This is my first ever language, but I know that it will be a great success and many people will use it after my death.  

## What to do ?

Syntax :  
+ Comments
+ Integers and Floats
+ Negative numbers
+ Assignations

Language tools :  
+ Erlang executable to compile file (lexical / syntax)
+ Erlang executable to execute file

##Â Bases of the language.


My language is what you can call and expressive langague, that means that everything is an expression. A function, an expression, a condition and even a dot.
